# SeeScript's Future
SeeScript is a programming language + NPM Module that allows you to programmatically create SVG animations. 

## Revised Goal
To create a NPM Module for the programming language, so you can embed animations into any website. For this to work, I will need the NPM module to act as a 'Movie Player' for the animations. Users will be able to feed in code using the SeeScript File Extension. A stretch goal to this would be to create syntax highlighting for VSCode.

# The Crater Programming Language & Interpeter
Crater is my personal research for a team research project. The goal of this project was to create a simple programming langauge which will allow for SVG animation. As a team of four, we all made seperate languages and interpeters in order to gain more knowledge in these areas. Crater will be able to support exporting and importing code as well as exporting animations created within the program. Not only will Crater allow for animations, but drawing as well. It will allow for exact meseaurements and creation of shapes. Crater will animate on a fixed-frame basis.

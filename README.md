# The Crater Programming Language & Interpreter
Crater is my personal research for a team research project at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. The goal of this project was to create a simple programming language which could allow for SVG animation. As a team of four, we all made separate languages and interpreters in order to better understand programming languages and to enhance our JavaScript skills.

## Weekly To Do List (Updated Every Friday)
